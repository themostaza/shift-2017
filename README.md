# React State Management Training

It covers three state management methods:
* React setState
* React + Redux
* React + MobX

## Training app
Actions:
* Fetch talk list (async action)
* Favourite talks (simple sync action)
* Filter talks (selectors / computed props)

## Example implementations

The `master` branch has not the full implementation but it has just the base code, you can develop the state managament specific code on top of that.

You can find the full implementation in the `original` branch.

### setState

```bash
  cd app-setstate
  npm install
```

### Redux

```bash
  cd app-redux
  npm install
```

### MobX

```bash
  cd app-mobx
  npm install
```
